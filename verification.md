## Notes for Business Analyst Review

### Issues Identified:
1. **Typo in Tax Free Savings:** "montly" should be "monthly" (appears in multiple sections)
2. **Typo in Local Unit Trust for Minor:** "debit order amount o" should be "debit order amount of"
3. **Inconsistent Product Names:** Some sections use dynamic product names while others use hardcoded names like "Ninety One Retirement Annuity Fund"
4. **Retirement Annuity Section:** Has conflicting text - mentions both child and standard investment in the same paragraph

### Recommendations:
1. Review all processing timeframes for consistency
2. Standardize disclaimer text across similar investment types
3. Ensure contact information is consistent across all sections
4. Review fee structure presentations for clarity
5. Check if all reward redemption text is necessary and consistent
